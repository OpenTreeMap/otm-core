# We use Firefox and selenium for running UI tests. But using the latest 
# versions is fragile because every few months a Firefox release is incompatible
# with the current selenium. Since our UI tests don't depend on the latest features
# of either we now use specific versions known to work together.
#
# Only update the selenium version number below if you know it works with
# the currently-provisioned Firefox version.
